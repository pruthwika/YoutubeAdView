# **YoutubeAdViewPrediction**

This project focuses on predicting ad views for YouTube videos using advanced technologies like  Deep  Learning  and  Machine  Learning.
The  techniques  like  Linear  Regression  (LR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to train the model. 
The result achieved is that the  Random Forest  algorithm  obtained the minimum  RMSE.
Finally, the decision tree regressor was saved and implemented on test dadasetfor predicting ad-views for the test data.
